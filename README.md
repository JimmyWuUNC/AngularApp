This application requires MySQL. The SQL script for creating the necessary table is in app1-database.

After running "npm install" in app1-node and in app1-angular, you can start the application by running: "node server.js" in app1-node and "ng serve" in app1-angular.

UPDATE: to run the tests, run "ng test" using Angular CLI while in app1-angular folder.
